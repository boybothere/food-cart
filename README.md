# üçî Food Cart

This is a simple front-end project I built to understand how JavaScript Promises actually work in a real interaction.

You click the "Place Order" button, and under the hood, a bunch of async steps happen in order:
- It creates a fake order
- Proceeds to payment
- Shows an order summary
- Updates your wallet

I used plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks, just to keep things clean and focus on the logic.

The main goal was to practice **Promise chaining** and learn how to pass values down through each `.then()` without losing track of what‚Äôs going on.

It‚Äôs not a full app or anything ‚Äî more of a personal experiment to connect JS concepts with real UI behavior.

Feel free to explore or reuse!
